A small collection of snippets in different languages. Sourced from problem sets, books, and random places on the internet. Most of this was done for fun & to quickly learn/memorize a new language.

The project euler problems that were not done in python were done/checked with easyeuler, the python project euler problems were checked with EulerPy.

Some potential sources of problems in the future:

* r/dailyprogrammer (mature collection)
* SPOJ (lots of stuff)
* topcoder (decent tutorials)
* Kaggle (data sciency stuff)

1. Advent of Code
2. Programming Praxis (scheme friendly)
3. Cryptopals
4. 30 Days of Elixir
5. 99 Prolog Problems & derivatives

Looking for:
* problem sets & challenges designed for multiple cores
* problem sets & challenges for neural nets

Sources will be added as I find them.

PS: I write things in a very terse manner. The general format is as follows write as many abstract utilities as possible then use them to solve the question in a couple of lines.
