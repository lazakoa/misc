A small collection of snippets of code in different languages. Sourced from
problem sets, books, random places on the internet.

The Project Euler problems were done/checked with easyeuler.

Some potential sources of problems in the future:

1. Advent of Code
2. Programming Praxis
3. Cryptopals
4. 30 Days of Elixir

Sources will be added as I find them.
