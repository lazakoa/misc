A small collection of snippets of code in different languages. Sourced from
problem sets, books, random places on the internet. I use this to bootstrap
myself in different languages.



Good resources:

1. Project Euler using EulerPy <-- add different templates to this project
2. Advent of Code
3. Programming Praxis
4. Cryptopals
